# Sub species aeternitatis
### A blog about philosophy, AI and science
<hr>

## Description

This is the second version of my blog. It's hosted on an Ubuntu VPS and using Plesk as Webhosting-Control-Panel.
I reworked the whole backend and changed the whole structure.
Added MVC design-pattern, security middleware, express routes, jest tests, docker containerization, ESlint, ejs templates and extended backend logging.
Improved server protection with custom fail2ban jails and filters. 

Still in progress...
